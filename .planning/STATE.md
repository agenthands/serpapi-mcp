# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-15)

**Core value:** AI agents can search any SerpApi-supported engine through a single, authenticated MCP endpoint with structured parameter discovery and proper MCP-compliant error handling.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — project-foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (project-foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-15

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| — | 0 | — | — |

**Recent Trend:**

- No plans completed yet

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01 P01 | 4min | 2 tasks | 17 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Go rewrite replaces Python; legacy code archived in `legacy/`
- Official Go MCP SDK (`modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk`) as only external dependency
- Multi-platform static binaries via goreleaser (no Docker)
- Observability integrated into search phase (coarse granularity)
- Testing as final phase after all features built
- [Phase 01]: Go 1.25.0 directive in go.mod instead of 1.23 — Go toolchain management auto-upgrades; cannot be overridden without breaking go mod tidy
- [Phase 01]: Blank import of go-sdk/mcp in main.go keeps dependency as direct in go.mod; will be replaced with actual usage in Phase 2

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Engine schema generation still requires Python `build-engines.py` in CI (ENG-05 accepts this)
